  <h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>
  <p>We collect the information that you submit and which our business affiliates consider necessary for performing a preliminary evaluation of your qualifications for their products and services. Prior to sending your information to our business affiliates, we attempt to validate it. For example, we may compare and review your personal information for errors, omissions, and accuracy based upon past usage and response; or compare your information against other publicly available files; or validate some of the personal information submitted to verify that the information inputted has a high probability of being valid information.
    After we submit your information to our business affiliates, our business affiliates may begin a separate and independent evaluation of the information you submitted (the "Preliminary Application"). If our business affiliates find that the Preliminary Application meets with their more specific acceptance criterion, they may contact you directly by phone, mail or e-mail. For more information on how our business affiliates will handle your personal information, please visit our business affiliate's website, and review their privacy policy. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of our business affiliates' Web sites.
    Once you have registered with us, you are automatically enrolled to receive our Premium Service. We use the information you provided, along with other information described below, to create a general user profile. This profile can be created by combining your information with other sources of information such as information obtained from public databases, or from your browsing habits surrounding your visit to this Site.
    We may use personal information to provide the services you've requested, including wireless services that display customized content and advertising. In addition to any fee of which you are notified, your provider's standard messaging rates apply to our confirmation and all subsequent SMS correspondence. You may opt-out and remove your SMS information by sending "STOP", "END", "QUIT" to the SMS text message you have received. If you remove your SMS information from our database it will no longer be used by us for secondary purposes, disclosed to third parties, or used by us or third parties to send promotional correspondence to you.

    <h3>The Do Not Track browser settings</h3>
    <p>Advertisers may collect data about your online browsing activity and use it to show you targeted ads (a process known as "behavioral advertising‚Äù).
      You can prevent companies from showing you targeted ads by submitting opt-outs to those service providers.
      Opting-out will only prevent targeted ads so you may continue to see generic (non-targeted ads) from these companies after you opt-out.
      </p>
      <h3>WE MAY USE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE COLLECTED FOR ANY LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE PURPOSE, INCLUDING SELLING OR TRANSFERING SUCH INFORMATION AT ANY TIME TO THIRD PARTIES FOR ANY LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE PURPOSE.</h3>
      <p>For example, we may share your personal information with select business affiliates so that they can contact you and offer you products and or services that we believe might be of interest to you. This may include e-mail advertising, telephone marketing, direct mail marketing, and online banner advertising to name a few. In addition, we may maintain separate e-mail, mailing or phone lists for different purposes based on the information that you submitted and that we maintain. For your information, our business affiliates have all agreed to operate in accordance with federal and state laws and regulations relating to the handling of your personal information. You may learn more about any of our business affiliate's privacy policy by visiting our business affiliates' Web sites at such times as such affiliate may contact you.

        We cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personal information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. For example, third parties may unlawfully intercept personal data or access our servers and obtain personal data. Therefore, although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, nor you should not expect, that your personal information would always remain private.
        Certain sensitive information such as credit card numbers or other information such as social security numbers and drivers licenses ("Financial Information") collected on the site and associated data is encrypted and protected with SSL encryption software from the time it is captured by our application to the time it is transmitted to our servers.

        </p>
        <h3>Application of this Privacy Policy</h3>
        <p>This Privacy Policy applies to consumers that have signed up on the website. We may sell the personal information that you supply to us and we may work with other third party businesses to bring selected retail opportunities to our members via direct mail, email and telemarketing. These businesses may include providers of direct marketing services and applications, including lookup and reference, data enhancement, suppression and validation and email marketings</p>
        <h3>How We Protect Your Privacy</h3>
        <p>We protect your privacy in a number of ways. As an initial matter, any Financial Information transmitted to our servers via a secure server is encrypted using SSL technology. SSL is a protocol that transmits your communications over the Internet in an encrypted form. The protocol ensures that the information is sent, unchanged, only to the server you intended to send it to.
          Once your information reaches our server, it is protected by a firewall. With a firewall in place, your information is virtually inaccessible to third parties. In addition to encryption and firewall protections, we have all of our business affiliates agree to operate in accordance with federal and state laws and regulations, including regulations relating to CAN-SPAM and rules promulgated by the FTC. If we learn that any of our business affiliates are breaching our agreement, and therefore your trust, we will take corrective actions immediately or terminate our relationship with such business affiliate.
          We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can mail us at the address indicated below in the Contact Us section.
          </p>
          <h3>Changes; Opting-Out</h3>
          <p>If you want to change the information that you submitted, please do so by making another request through our Site. We will not be able to change information that is forwarded on to our business affiliates. Please contact the business affiliates directly to change any of your information.
            If you want to request to be removed from further communication with this Site, including our Premium Services, please Opt-out by emailing us at support@instantconvert.com to our Opt-out procedure. We will place your e-mail address on a suppression file associated with this Site.

Where there is a match, the planned email correspondence will be withheld, and such person will receive no further email correspondence from us. Your e-mail address will be placed on the suppression list associated with this Site within ten business (10) days of your request.
